## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned
In this project, I learned about the JavaScript use to modify a CSS class in a validation project. Exemple:


```js
    error_msg__email.style.display = "inline-block";
		error__icon__last.style.opacity = "1";
```


### Continued development

I need to study more JavaScript, since I felt difficulties in developing the script for this project.
